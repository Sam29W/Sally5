# STATUS

## Stage 0: Foundation — SHIPPED (2026-10-03)

### What was built

- pnpm workspace monorepo: `apps/api`, `apps/checkout-web` (placeholder), `apps/dashboard-web`
  (placeholder), `packages/shared`, `packages/config`.
- `infra/docker-compose.yml`: health-checked Postgres 16, Redis 7, Redpanda (Kafka-compatible).
- `packages/config`: `loadConfig()` (Zod-validated env schema, fails fast on boot with a
  readable error) and `createLogger()` (pino, redacts phone/OTP-shaped values by field name
  and by regex over free-text log messages).
- `apps/api`: NestJS app with a request-id middleware (honors inbound `x-request-id`, else
  generates a UUID) and a `GET /health` endpoint.
- GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): install → lint → format → typecheck → test
  → build.
- `.env.example`, root ESLint flat config + Prettier, base `tsconfig`.

### What was verified

- Typecheck, lint (`--max-warnings=0`), and format checks all pass clean.
- `pnpm run build` compiles every workspace package.
- `pnpm audit`: 1 critical (vitest, CVE in its UI server) found and fixed by bumping to
  `^3.2.6`. 21 residual low/moderate/high advisories remain, all transitive inside NestJS
  10's `express` dependency chain — tracked as a known gap, see
  [`docs/decisions/001-stage0-foundations.md`](docs/decisions/001-stage0-foundations.md).
- `gitleaks` installed, run for real against the working tree and full git history: no
  leaks found. Wired into CI (`gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2`) and enforced locally via a
  husky `pre-commit` hook (`gitleaks protect --staged`).
- End-to-end smoke test: brought up `docker compose`, started the built API against it,
  confirmed `GET /health` returns `200 {"status":"ok",...}` with an `x-request-id` header.

### Test results

- `packages/config`: 4/4 tests pass (`redactPII` — phone redaction, OTP redaction, mixed,
  and negative/untouched-text cases).
- `apps/api`: 1/1 test passes (`GET /health` returns `200` with `status: "ok"`).
- Full suite (`pnpm run test`): 5/5 passing, 0 flaky.

### Known gaps / follow-ups

- `apps/checkout-web` and `apps/dashboard-web` are placeholder packages only — real
  SvelteKit apps land in Stage 6 and Stage 8.
- Residual non-critical `pnpm audit` findings in NestJS 10's transitive deps — revisit on a
  future NestJS major bump.
- Local Postgres is mapped to host port `55432` (not `5432`) to avoid clashing with other
  unrelated Docker containers already running on this dev machine — see decision 001.
- Package scope is the neutral `@app/*` pending a final product name — see decision 001.
